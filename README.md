[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/lucasmartins/igs_pie_chart.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/lucasmartins/igs_pie_chart) [![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/lucasmartins/igs_pie_chart.png?travis)](https://gemnasium.com/lucasmartins/igs_pie_chart) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/badge.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/lucasmartins/igs_pie_chart)


Pie Chart is a gem for pizza/donut (charts) making. It uses D3 (Data Driven Documents) to aggregate the data and render SVG awesomeness into an HTML element of your choosing.

Pie Chart is the first piece of the Innovative Graph Suite, different ways to visualize your data will be available in the near future.

Pie Chart is not production ready yet, although it works fine.

The RDoc is not available yet, but there are few files to peek and the [test](https://github.com/lucasmartins/igs_pie_chart/blob/master/test/test_igs_pie_chart.rb) shows how it works.


Requirements
------------

### Ruby and Rails

This gem is tested against the latest version of RoR, other versions are not our focus now.
Rails is not really needed, but apparently our main dependency 'd3_rails' requires you to install all Rails gems, we will work on that in the future.
